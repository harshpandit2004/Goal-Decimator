This repository contains the code for my first React Native project, developed while following Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Udemy course "React Native - The Practical Guide 2023".

## Project Overview

The project is a beginner-level application that allows users to add achievable course goals and displays those goals in a list. Additionally, users have the option to "decimate" their goals by tapping on individual elements.
